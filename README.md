# Frontend Developer Challenge

Welcome to the Frontend Developer Challenge! This is a simple challenge designed to test my skills in building web pages.

## Overview

The SGBr services primarily utilize Vue 3, Quasar, Tailwind CSS, and Pinia technologies. My task is to create a web page that consumes data from the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/), featuring infinite scrolling of gifs, a search option, and an enlarged view of the selected gif.

## Requirements

- Create a web page that consumes data from the Giphy API.
- Implement infinite scrolling of gifs.
- Include a search option to filter gifs.
- Provide a feature for viewing selected gifs in an enlarged format.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these instructions:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliafclima/gif-tok-vue.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd gif-tok-vue
```

3. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080` (or the appropriate port number if it's different).
